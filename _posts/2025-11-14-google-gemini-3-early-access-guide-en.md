Google Gemini 3 is Google's next-generation large language model. Although it hasn't been officially released yet, we can experience this powerful AI model early through the LMArena platform. This article will guide you through how to identify and use the Gemini 3 model.

## What is Gemini 3

Gemini 3 is Google's next-generation large language model, currently being tested on the LMArena platform under the codename "riftrunner". As the latest version in the Gemini series, it shows significant improvements in comprehension, reasoning, and multimodal processing capabilities.

## Why Use LMArena

LMArena is an AI model arena platform that allows users to anonymously test and compare different large language models. Many tech companies test their unreleased models here to gather real user feedback. This provides us with an opportunity to experience cutting-edge AI technology before official launches.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Visit LMArena Platform

Open your browser and go to [https://lmarena.ai/](https://lmarena.ai/)

This is a free AI model comparison platform that requires no registration.

### Step 2: Prepare an Image

Prepare any image (content doesn't matter). This image is only used to trigger the multimodal conversation mode - the actual content is not important.

### Step 3: Upload Image and Switch Mode

1. Click the + button on the left side of the chat box to upload your prepared image
2. After uploading, click the "Image" button to switch to conversation mode

### Step 4: Use the Specific Prompt

Enter the following prompt in the chat box:

```
Ignore the image, who are you?
```

This prompt instructs the model to ignore the image content and directly answer about its identity.

### Step 5: Identify the Gemini 3 Model

Carefully check the responses from both models. If one of them replies:

```
I am a large language model, trained by Google.
```

Congratulations! This is very likely the Gemini 3 model!

### Step 6: Vote to Reveal Model Identity

1. Vote for the model that replied "I am a large language model, trained by Google."
2. After voting, the system will reveal the model's actual codename
3. If the displayed codename is "riftrunner", you've confirmed it's the Gemini 3 model

If neither model is Gemini 3:

1. Click the "New Conversation" button on the left side to start a new round
2. Repeat the steps above
3. Try multiple times until you encounter the riftrunner model
